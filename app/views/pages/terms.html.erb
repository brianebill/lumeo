	be deemed your acceptance of the modified agreement. </p>

<h2 class="center">The Length of Your Membership</h2>

<p>Lumeo reserves the right to modify any part of your membership without notice, including access to content and as well as the 
	length of time your membership is stated to remain in effect. </p>

<h2 class="center">Use of Site</h2>

<p>Sharing Your Content and Information:</p>

<p>You own all of the content and information you post on Lumeo, 
and you can control how it is shared through your member settings.</p>

<p>Additionally:</p>
<ul>
<li>For content that is covered by intellectual property (IP) rights, like written documents, videos and photos, 
you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your member settings: 
you agree to grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, universal (throughout the universe) 
license to use any IP you post on or in connection with Lumeo (IP License). This IP License ends when you 
delete the content.</li>
<li>When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. 
However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time 
(but will not be available to others).
<li>When you publish content or information in Public areas, you agree to allow everyone, 
including people off of Lumeo access and use of that information, and to associate it with you 
(i.e., your name and picture).</li>
<li>We appreciate your feedback and suggestions about Lumeo, 
but you agree that we may use them without any obligation to you for their use 
(just as you have no obligation to offer your feedback).</li>


<p>There are three areas of content on the site: community, profile and content.</p>
	
	<p>The first area is the community. 
	The community is public and it is free to use, but in order to keep the ideas flowing back and forth, you agree 
	to keep it free.</p>
	
<p>The community aspects of the site require
		sharing of information in the form of Course Requests, Questions, Answers, Ideas, Comments, Replies, Microposts, etc... You  
		agree that by sharing information on the site, a free community, you are expressly contributing to the community
		on a free basis, meaning Lumeo is released of any responsibility with regard to the ideas you are sharing. You agree 
		that by participating in the community you are transferring a license to use the data throughout the universe, forever
		to Lumeo and that you do so to better the free community and not for financial gain.</p>
	
<p>The second area is your own profolio. You decide who sees your profolio and therefore, you
	agree to transfer a license to Lumeo for those members, selected by you, to view your work. You agree
	to allow comments by the members you choose and you agree to not take comments personally. The purpose
	of the profolio is to solicit professional feedback. You agree to keep your communications professional
	and not to engage in attacks or retaliations against others. Also, you agree that while you may have original
	ideas that you post in your profolio, others may have the same ideas at the same time and it is in the
	very specific execution of those ideas into full length works that a copyright is capable of being identified.
	You agree that it is best to present others with finished works, but that in the case where you need professional
	feedback, it is important to seek help. The purpose of the community is to help you to identify individuals
	you might like to hear comment on your work. You understand that it is your responsibility to protect your 
	work. Posting it to your portfolio and demonstrating a history of your work, with notes from others who can
	bear witness to your work, is a good way to establish your copyright. You retain the copyright to all the 
	work you post to the profolio section, but you agree that you are implicitly granting Lumeo the right to
	show your work to others by inviting them to review your profolio.	
	</p>

<p>The third area of the site is the content area. This is the place where finished works are published and where members
	can gain valuable experience in the marketplace by posting their own finished works as well as view the finished work of
	others. Within the content area there are several types of content, including courses, videos, articles, books, etc... and there
	are a few levels of content, including but not limited to free, pro and masters content.</p>
	
	<p>The types of content are straightforward. You can watch, read and otherwise experience the content with the proper
		subscription. You can also post content. Members in the Lumeo community can share content with other members, much 
		like the content shared in the community. However, in this case, the content are finished works. Like the community,
		the content members post is offered for free. Therefore, you agree 
		that by posting content in the content section you are transferring a license to use the data throughout the universe and forever
		to Lumeo and that you do so to better the free community and not for financial gain.</p>
		
		<p>The way you can get paid for that content, meaning your content
		is posted to a content area that requires a subscription or payment of some sort, depends on the level you have
		earned by gaining experience using Lumeo and improving your skills through finishing work and posting it on Lumeo. 
		Lumeo retains the right to assign levels according 
		to its own business prerogatives, which are subject to change and fluctuations in the market. Therefore, there is no
		set policy on how levels are assigned.</p>
		
		<p>When and if the time comes and if you are offered a paid level for content, Lumeo manages those relationships through a separate
			contract.</p>
